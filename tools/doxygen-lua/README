Doxygen-Lua

Doxygen::Lua is a preprocessor to make Doxygen support Lua syntax.

A script named "lua2dox" is shipped with this module. Just simply
modify your Doxyfile as below:

    FILTER_PATTERNS = *.lua=/path/to/your/lua2dox

That's all! Then you can document lua files as same as c files! 

The default doxygen mark is '--!'. It can be chnaged by "mark" method.
Please see Doxygen::Lua perldoc for detail information.

Run "doxygen" in the "example" directory can generate a example documentation.

I had to map .lua files to "JavaScript" in the Doxyfile, to get this working.
